# Instructions

In your home directory, clone the repo, then run the setup script.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/AtlasICL/dotfiles
chmod +x ./dotfiles/setup.sh
./dotfiles/setup.sh
```

# Notes

- You should modify the `.gitconfig` in your home folder to with your name and email.
- NeoVim requires a nerd font. I use [this one](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono), 
it is free and open source.
